# ***Domain I: Business Problem Framing (≈14%)***

## **Identify Initial Problem Statement and Desired Outcomes**

The **initial problem statement** is foundational for framing the
business challenge. It should capture the essence of the issue,
specifying whether it's an opportunity, threat, or operational glitch.

### Best Practices for Problem Statement:

1.  **Clear and Concise:** Avoid ambiguity and ensure the problem
    statement is easily understandable.
    -   **Example:** Instead of saying "Improve sales," specify
        "Increase quarterly sales by 10% in the North American market."
2.  **Specific and Measurable:** Define the scope clearly with
    measurable outcomes.
    -   **Example:** "Reduce production defects by 15% within six months
        by improving the quality control process."
3.  **Aligned with Organizational Goals:** Ensure it aligns with the
    strategic objectives of the organization.
    -   **Example:** "Enhance customer satisfaction by 20% by the end of
        Q3 to align with our corporate mission of prioritizing customer
        experience."
4.  **Action-Oriented:** Focus on what needs to be done to address the
    issue.
    -   **Example:** "Implement a new CRM system to streamline customer
        interactions and improve response times by 25%."

### Use the Five W's:

This method helps systematically outline the problem:

-   **Who** is affected or involved? (e.g., employees, customers,
    shareholders)
    -   **Example:** "Sales team, marketing department, current and
        potential customers."
-   **What** is the main issue or opportunity? (e.g., stagnating growth,
    operational inefficiency)
    -   **Example:** "Sales are not meeting targets despite an increase
        in marketing efforts."
-   **Where** does the issue manifest? (e.g., specific departments,
    locations)
    -   **Example:** "The issue is primarily in the North American sales
        division."
-   **When** did the problem start or when does it need resolution?
    (e.g., historical trends, deadlines)
    -   **Example:** "The decline in sales began in Q1 and needs
        resolution by the end of Q3."
-   **Why** is this issue occurring, and what are its root causes?
    (e.g., market changes, internal policies)
    -   **Example:** "The decline is due to increased competition and a
        lack of product differentiation."

### Example:

-   **Initial Problem Statement:** "Our Seattle plant's production
    inefficiencies have led to missed deadlines over the past two
    quarters, affecting our West Coast distribution."
-   **Refined Problem Statement:** "To address production inefficiencies
    at our Seattle plant, we aim to optimize scheduling and
    manufacturing processes to enhance on-time delivery performance and
    reduce operational costs."

### Example Five W's Analysis

        explanations accordingly.
    -   Example: "Did my explanation of the predictive model make sense?
        Would you like more details on any part?"

### Example Scenario:

When explaining a machine learning model to a business team, use
visualizations to show how the model predicts outcomes based on
historical data, rather than delving into the mathematical details.

### Detailed Steps:

1.  **Identify Key Concepts:**
    -   Determine the technical concepts that need to be explained.
    -   Example: "Predictive maintenance, machine learning algorithms,
        and model accuracy."
2.  **Develop Analogies:**
    -   Create simple analogies that relate to everyday experiences.
    -   Example: "Just like a doctor predicts your health based on
        symptoms and medical history, our model predicts machine
        failures based on historical performance data."
3.  **Use Visualizations:**
    -   Create visual aids to support the explanation.
    -   Example: "A line graph showing predicted versus actual machine
        downtimes over time."
4.  **Seek Feedback:**
    -   Ask stakeholders if they understood the explanation and clarify
        any doubts.
    -   Example: "Does this visualization help you understand how we
        predict machine failures? Are there any parts that are still
        unclear?"

## **Summary**

An analytics professional needs to blend technical expertise with strong
communication skills to ensure the success of analytics projects. This

# ***Review Questions***

These questions will never be on the CAP® certification exam: they are
here solely as study aids. All questions on the certification exam are
multiple choice with four possible correct answers of which only one is
correct.

## **Question 1**

What are the 5 W’s?

### Answer

-   Who are the stakeholders
-   What is the problem
-   Where is the problem occurring
-   When does the problem occur
-   Why does the problem occur?

### Explanation

The 5 W’s are fundamental questions used in problem-solving, root cause
analysis, and investigative processes to gain a comprehensive
understanding of a situation. Here's why each is important:

-   **Who are the stakeholders**: Identifying stakeholders helps
    understand who is affected by the problem and who can influence or
    has an interest in its resolution. Stakeholders can include
    customers, employees, management, suppliers, and others.

-   **What is the problem**: Clearly defining the problem ensures that
    everyone involved has a shared understanding of the issue that needs
    to be addressed. This helps in focusing efforts on the right problem
    without miscommunication or ambiguity.

-   **Where is the problem occurring**: Knowing the location or context
    in which the problem arises can help in pinpointing specific areas
    or processes that need attention. This is crucial for diagnosing
    issues that may be environment-specific.

-   **When does the problem occur**: Understanding the timing or
    frequency of the problem can reveal patterns or triggers that are
    contributing to the issue. This can be useful in identifying whether
    the problem is constant, periodic, or sporadic.

-   **Why does the problem occur**: Determining the root cause of the
    problem is essential for developing effective solutions. By asking
    why the problem occurs, one can uncover underlying issues that need
    to be addressed to prevent recurrence.

These questions form the basis of many analytical and problem-solving
methodologies, such as the 5 Whys technique, and are integral to
structured problem-solving processes in various fields, including
business analysis, quality improvement, and operational research.

## **Question 2**

What is a stakeholder?

### Answer

Stakeholders are all who are affected by the problem and its solution.
Note that this may include more than those in the initial meetings and
those in charge of the problem solution.

### Explanation

Stakeholders play a critical role in the problem-solving and
decision-making process for several reasons:

-   **Broad Impact**: Stakeholders encompass anyone who is affected by
    the problem or the solution. This includes direct participants like
    employees, customers, and managers, as well as indirect participants
    such as suppliers, shareholders, and community members. Recognizing
    all stakeholders ensures that the solution addresses the needs and
    concerns of all affected parties.

-   **Diverse Perspectives**: Involving a wide range of stakeholders
    brings in diverse viewpoints and expertise, which can lead to a more
    comprehensive understanding of the problem and more innovative
    solutions. Stakeholders from different areas may identify issues and
    opportunities that others may overlook.

-   **Support and Buy-In**: Engaging stakeholders early and throughout
    the process helps build support for the solution. When stakeholders
    feel that their input is valued and considered, they are more likely
    to be committed to the implementation and success of the solution.

-   **Risk Management**: Identifying and involving stakeholders helps in
    anticipating potential risks and resistance. Stakeholders can
    provide insights into potential challenges and help develop
    strategies to mitigate these risks.

-   **Resource Allocation**: Understanding who the stakeholders are can
    aid in the efficient allocation of resources. Stakeholders can help
    prioritize efforts based on their impact and importance, ensuring
    that the most critical issues are addressed first.

In summary, stakeholders are vital to the success of problem-solving
initiatives because they provide essential insights, support, and
resources needed to effectively address the problem and implement a
sustainable solution.

## **Question 3**

How could a problem not be amenable to an analytics solution?

### Answer

Problems may be constrained by limitations of the tools, methods, and
data available or the feasibility of the solution.

### Explanation

-   **Tool Limitations**: The available analytical tools might not be
    capable of handling the complexity or specific requirements of the
    problem. This could be due to insufficient computational power, lack
    of appropriate software, or limitations in the algorithms
    themselves.
-   **Methodological Constraints**: The problem might not be suited to
    existing analytical methods. For instance, some problems require
    innovative approaches or methodologies that are not yet developed or
    well-understood.
-   **Data Availability**: Adequate and relevant data are crucial for
    any analytics solution. If the necessary data are unavailable,
    incomplete, or of poor quality, it becomes challenging to apply
    analytics effectively. Without the right data, the analysis might
    not yield meaningful or accurate insights.
-   **Data Privacy and Security**: Issues related to data privacy and
    security can also hinder the use of analytics. Regulatory
    constraints and the need to protect sensitive information might
    limit the ability to collect and analyze data.
-   **Feasibility**: Even if the tools, methods, and data are available,
    the cost, time, or effort required to implement an analytics
    solution might not be feasible. The solution might be too complex or
    resource-intensive to be practical in the given context.
-   **Interpretability and Actionability**: The results of the analysis
    must be interpretable and actionable. If the insights generated by
    the analytics are too complex to understand or do not lead to clear,
    actionable steps, the problem might not be suitable for an analytics
    solution.
-   **Change Management**: Organizational readiness and willingness to
    act on the analytical insights are crucial. If the organization is
    not prepared to implement changes based on the analysis, the problem
    may remain unsolved.

In summary, a problem might not be amenable to an analytics solution due
to limitations in tools, methods, data availability, feasibility,
interpretability, actionability, and organizational readiness. These
constraints can prevent the effective application of analytics to solve
the problem.

## **Question 4**

Suppose that the business problem is that the organization wants to
increase sales by increasing cross-selling to existing customers. Your
project sponsor looks to you to tell her how the organization can get
there based on the data at hand. What’s your first move?

a.  Dive into existing customer interaction data

b.  Ask your sponsor if she has a particular customer segment in mind

c.  Talk with marketing to see what they have planned for the next sales
    campaign

d.  Ask your sponsor what the actual numeric target of increased sales
    is overall

### Answer

Note that your sponsor didn’t give you much information to go on, and
you don’t know what your goal really is, except that you know you’re
looking to get more sales per customer. There’s not enough to go on here
to start to formulate the problem. `Choice D` would be the best response
to start to get some numbers to go with the business’ goal.

### Explanation

Choosing
`d. Ask your sponsor what the actual numeric target of increased sales is overall`
is the best initial move for several reasons:

-   **Clarifying Objectives**: Understanding the specific numeric target
    for increased sales provides a clear and measurable goal. This helps
    in setting a concrete benchmark against which progress can be
    measured, ensuring that efforts are aligned with the business’s
    expectations.

-   **Defining Success**: Knowing the numeric target helps define what
    success looks like. It allows you to quantify the desired outcome,
    which is essential for planning and assessing the effectiveness of
    your strategies and actions.

-   **Resource Allocation**: A clear target helps in determining the
    resources needed to achieve the goal. It informs decisions on the
    allocation of budget, personnel, and time, ensuring that resources
    are used efficiently to meet the desired sales increase.

-   **Strategic Planning**: With a defined target, you can develop a
    more focused and effective strategy. It allows you to tailor your
    approach to meet the specific sales increase goal, rather than
    working with vague or broad objectives.

-   **Baseline and Metrics**: Establishing the target provides a
    baseline from which to measure progress. It helps in setting up key
    performance indicators (KPIs) and other metrics to monitor the
    effectiveness of cross-selling initiatives and make data-driven
    adjustments as needed.

-   **Stakeholder Alignment**: Asking for the numeric target ensures
    that all stakeholders, including your project sponsor, are aligned
    on the goals and expectations. It fosters better communication and
    collaboration, reducing the risk of misunderstandings or misaligned
    efforts.

In summary, by asking your sponsor for the actual numeric target of
increased sales, you gain the necessary clarity and specificity to
formulate a well-defined problem and develop a targeted, strategic
approach to achieving the organization’s cross-selling objectives.

## **Question 5**

Your sponsor has come back with a numeric goal of increasing sales from
an average of \$10,000 per customer to \$11,000 per customer in the next
12 months. What’s your next move?

a.  See what price/sales volume data exist to see if the organization’s
    prices match value

b.  See what sales by customer data exist

c.  Create hypotheses of which customer segments could be cross-sold

d.  Explore whether there are any other related business goals

### Answer

Even given the statement above, you don’t yet have a complete view of
the business problem. You don’t know why the organization has chosen to
focus its attention on increasing sales per customer. Without that, you
don’t know what margins are acceptable on those sales. You may assume
that general business rules apply and that you should assume that any
sales under a 20% margin are inherently unprofitable and should be
rejected. But without surfacing and clarifying that assumption and many
others, you don’t know if it is valid or not. You have to ask and keep
asking until you know what assumptions are valid. Again, `Choice D` is
the most appropriate answer.

### Explanation

Choosing `d. Explore whether there are any other related business goals`
is the best next move for several reasons:

-   **Comprehensive Understanding**: Exploring other related business
    goals provides a broader context for the sales increase target.
    Understanding how this goal fits within the larger organizational
    strategy helps ensure that efforts are aligned with overall business
    objectives.

-   **Clarifying Motivations**: Knowing why the organization has chosen
    to focus on increasing sales per customer can reveal underlying
    motivations and priorities. This could include improving customer
    loyalty, increasing market share, or enhancing profitability.
    Understanding these motivations helps tailor strategies to achieve
    the desired outcomes effectively.

-   **Assumption Validation**: Without understanding the full context
    and related business goals, assumptions about acceptable margins,
    profitability, and strategic priorities may be incorrect. Clarifying
    these assumptions is crucial to ensure that the strategies developed
    are viable and aligned with the organization’s broader objectives.

-   **Identifying Constraints and Opportunities**: Related business
    goals might highlight constraints that need to be considered, such
    as budget limitations or resource availability. They may also reveal
    opportunities for synergy, such as leveraging existing marketing
    campaigns or cross-departmental initiatives.

-   **Strategic Alignment**: Ensuring that the goal of increasing sales
    per customer is aligned with other business goals helps in creating
    a coherent strategy. This alignment ensures that all efforts
    contribute to the overall success of the organization, rather than
    working at cross-purposes.

-   **Informed Decision-Making**: With a comprehensive understanding of
    related business goals, you can make more informed decisions about
    the best approach to increase sales. This might involve prioritizing
    certain customer segments, adjusting pricing strategies, or
    enhancing product offerings.

In summary, by exploring whether there are any other related business
goals, you gain a deeper understanding of the context and motivations
behind the numeric sales target. This helps in developing a
well-informed, strategic approach that is aligned with the
organization’s overall objectives and ensures the success of the
cross-selling initiative.

## **Question 6**

You now have a little more information from the project sponsor, along
with several rumors from other sources. You know that you should base
the cost of increased sales over current levels at the marginal cost,
rather than the fully allocated cost; that the company has to maintain
at least the same return on sales as it currently has as the sales
increase from \$10,000 per customer to \$11,000 per customer; and that
top-line revenue must also increase by 10% (i.e., you can’t get there by
dropping your lowest-performing customers). Once you’ve listed these
assumptions or rules in your project charter, what’s next?

a.  Start creating your input/output diagrams about what drives current
    customers to buy more

b.  Talk with your marketing and data groups to see what data exist

c.  Figure out how the increased sales goal should be broken down into
    metrics

d.  Run a conjoint analysis to see if existing products can be tweaked
    to be worth more money

### Answer

Here the most appropriate answer is `Choice A`. This is important
because if you go straight to looking at data, your hypotheses about
what’s important will be inherently biased by the existing data and
explanations. If the answer were in your existing explanations, you
probably wouldn’t have the problem in the first place. But now that you
have the initial set of drivers, you can start talking with your data
group and decomposing your metrics to allocate the increased performance
to performing groups. Any group with changing goals needs to be on your
stakeholder list and part of the reviews.

### Explanation

Choosing
`a. Start creating your input/output diagrams about what drives current customers to buy more`
is the best next step for several reasons:

-   **Avoiding Bias**: If you dive directly into existing data, you may
    unintentionally bias your analysis based on what data is available
    and how it has been previously interpreted. This can lead to
    overlooking new or different factors that could be critical to
    understanding and solving the problem.

-   **Understanding Drivers**: Creating input/output diagrams helps in
    identifying the key factors that influence customer purchasing
    behavior. This understanding is crucial for developing effective
    strategies to increase sales per customer. By mapping out these
    drivers, you can gain insights into what motivates customers to buy
    more and how these motivations can be leveraged.

-   **Hypothesis Formation**: Input/output diagrams allow you to form
    hypotheses about the relationships between different variables and
    customer behavior. These hypotheses can then be tested and refined
    using data analysis, ensuring that your approach is grounded in a
    thorough understanding of the business problem.

-   **Framework for Analysis**: Input/output diagrams provide a
    structured framework for your analysis. They help in organizing your
    thoughts and ensuring that you consider all relevant factors. This
    can make your subsequent data collection and analysis more targeted
    and effective.

-   **Collaboration and Communication**: Having a clear visual
    representation of what drives customer behavior facilitates better
    communication and collaboration with stakeholders. It ensures that
    everyone involved has a shared understanding of the key factors and
    can contribute more effectively to the solution.

-   **Foundation for Metrics**: Once you have identified the key drivers
    of customer behavior, you can use this understanding to develop
    specific metrics and performance indicators. This helps in tracking
    progress towards the sales increase goal and making data-driven
    adjustments as needed.

In summary, starting with input/output diagrams about what drives
current customers to buy more helps ensure that your analysis is
comprehensive and unbiased. It lays a strong foundation for subsequent
data collection, hypothesis testing, and strategy development,
ultimately leading to more effective solutions for increasing sales per
customer.

## **Question 7**

Speaking of reviews, which of these groups should NOT be invited?

a.  Data group

b.  Sales & Marketing

c.  Manufacturing

d.  Contracts

### Answer

Any group with changing requirements needs to be invited. If you plan on
selling more items, then the manufacturing group needs to be part of the
discussion so they can advise on how much they can actually produce
before requiring more investment for another line, more employees, etc.

### Explanation

The group that should NOT be invited to the reviews is `d. Contracts`.
Here’s why:

-   **Data Group**: The data group is crucial because they provide the
    necessary data and analytics support. They help in gathering,
    analyzing, and interpreting data, which is essential for making
    informed decisions about increasing sales and understanding customer
    behavior.

-   **Sales & Marketing**: Sales and marketing teams are directly
    involved in the execution of strategies to increase sales. They
    provide insights into customer needs, market trends, and promotional
    tactics that can drive sales growth. Their input is vital for
    aligning strategies with market realities and customer expectations.

-   **Manufacturing**: Manufacturing must be included because they are
    responsible for producing the goods that will be sold. They need to
    understand the sales targets and assess their capacity to meet
    increased demand. This includes evaluating whether they can scale
    production, what investments might be needed, and how to manage
    supply chain logistics.

-   **Contracts**: While the contracts group handles legal agreements
    and terms of business deals, they do not directly influence the
    operational aspects of increasing sales or managing production
    capacity. Their involvement is more relevant during the final stages
    when terms of new deals or agreements need to be formalized.
    Therefore, they are not as critical to the strategic discussions
    about how to achieve the sales increase.

In summary, the contracts group should not be invited to the initial
strategic reviews because their role does not directly impact the
operational planning and execution of sales and manufacturing
strategies. Involving the data group, sales and marketing, and
manufacturing ensures that all critical aspects of the sales increase
goal are covered, from data analysis to production capacity.

## **Question 8**

Describe the main differences between discrete-event simulation and
Monte Carlo simulation.

### Answer

Monte Carlo simulation is about generating random numbers and processes
them to predict another variable without focusing necessarily on the
accumulated queues and the impact of time. On the other hand, the focus
of discrete event simulation is to study the accumulated queues as time
goes. A discrete event simulation may include Monte Carlo runs as we can
run random numbers in DES, but not necessarily.

### Explanation

-   **Monte Carlo Simulation**:
    -   **Focus**: Monte Carlo simulation focuses on generating random
        numbers to model and predict the behavior of a variable. It is
        used to understand the impact of risk and uncertainty in
        prediction and forecasting models.
    -   **Application**: It is commonly used in finance, risk analysis,
        and decision making under uncertainty. For example, it can
        predict stock prices, evaluate the risk of investment
        portfolios, or forecast the probability of project completion
        times.
    -   **Time Impact**: Monte Carlo simulation does not typically
        consider the impact of time or the sequence of events. It is
        more about the distribution of outcomes and the probabilities
        associated with different scenarios.
    -   **Methodology**: It involves running many simulations with
        random inputs to create a distribution of possible outcomes,
        allowing for statistical analysis of these outcomes.
-   **Discrete-Event Simulation (DES)**:
    -   **Focus**: Discrete-event simulation focuses on modeling the
        operation of a system as a sequence of events over time. Each
        event occurs at a specific point in time and marks a change in
        the state of the system.
    -   **Application**: It is used in fields like operations research,
        logistics, manufacturing, and service systems. For example, it
        can simulate the flow of customers through a bank, the operation
        of a production line, or the performance of a computer network.
    -   **Time Impact**: DES explicitly considers the passage of time
        and the sequence of events. It models the system dynamics and
        interactions over time, allowing for the analysis of queues,
        waiting times, resource utilization, and system bottlenecks.
    -   **Methodology**: It involves creating a model that represents
        the system as a series of discrete events, each occurring at a
        particular time. The simulation tracks the state of the system
        and updates it as events occur.

In summary, while Monte Carlo simulation focuses on probabilistic
predictions and risk analysis without considering the impact of time,
discrete-event simulation models the dynamic behavior of systems over
time, analyzing how events and queues evolve. Both methodologies can
involve random number generation, but their applications and focus areas
differ significantly.

## **Question 9**

A post office area manager received many complaints that the only branch
she has in the north side of the town has a very long waiting time. She
hired you as a consultant to recommend justifying opening new positions
in her branch. What would be a relevant methodology to use?

a.  Monte Carlo simulation

b.  Queuing theory

c.  Data mining

d.  Linear programming

### Answer

`b. Queuing theory`

### Explanation

Queuing theory is the most relevant methodology in this scenario because
it is specifically designed to study waiting lines or queues. Queuing
theory provides the mathematical models and tools necessary to analyze
various aspects of the queue, such as the arrival rate of customers, the
service rate of clerks, the number of servers, and the capacity of the
queue.

Using queuing theory, you can:

-   **Model the Arrival and Service Processes**: Determine the
    distribution of inter-arrival times of customers and the service
    times of clerks.
-   **Analyze System Performance**: Evaluate key performance metrics
    such as average waiting time, average queue length, and the
    probability of a customer having to wait.
-   **Predict the Impact of Changes**: Simulate the effect of adding
    more clerks (servers) to see how it reduces the waiting time and
    improves customer satisfaction.
-   **Optimize Resource Allocation**: Help justify the need for
    additional clerks by demonstrating how increased staffing levels can
    lead to more efficient service and reduced wait times.

By applying queuing theory, you can provide quantitative evidence to
support the decision to open new positions, thereby addressing the
complaints and improving the overall service quality at the post office
branch.

## **Question 10**

main causes for fatal failures in their battery system. The best
methodology to use to pinpoint the root causes is:

a.  Conduct a well-prepared design of experiments.

b.  Use historical data to relate failures to potential causes.

c.  Simulate the process with all the failure modes.

d.  Choice B or C

### Answer

`d. Choice B or C`

### Explanation

Choosing `d. Choice B or C` is the best answer for determining the main
causes of fatal failures in the battery system for several reasons:

-   **Using Historical Data (Choice B)**:
    -   **Data-Driven Insights**: Analyzing historical data can provide
        valuable insights into patterns and correlations between past
        failures and potential causes. This approach leverages existing
        data to identify trends and root causes that have led to
        failures.
    -   **Reliability**: Historical data offers real-world evidence and
        can highlight recurring issues, helping to prioritize which
        potential causes need further investigation.
    -   **Efficiency**: It is often quicker and less resource-intensive
        to analyze existing data compared to conducting new experiments
        or simulations.
-   **Simulating the Process with Failure Modes (Choice C)**:
    -   **Comprehensive Analysis**: Simulation allows for the modeling
        of complex systems and the examination of various failure modes
        under different conditions. This can help in understanding how
        different factors interact and contribute to failures.
    -   **Scenario Testing**: Simulations can test a wide range of
        scenarios and conditions that may not be feasible or safe to
        replicate in real-world experiments. This helps in identifying
        potential causes that might not be apparent from historical data
        alone.
    -   **Predictive Capability**: By simulating the process, the
        company can predict how changes to the system might impact the
        likelihood of failures, providing a proactive approach to
        preventing issues.
-   **Combined Approach (Choice D)**:
    -   **Holistic View**: Using both historical data and simulations
        provides a more comprehensive understanding of the causes of
        failures. Historical data can guide the simulation parameters,
        making the simulations more realistic and grounded in real-world
        evidence.
    -   **Cross-Validation**: Findings from historical data analysis can
        be validated and further explored through simulations. This
        helps in confirming hypotheses and ensuring robustness in the
        identification of root causes.
    -   **Resource Optimization**: Combining both methods allows for
        efficient use of resources by focusing simulations on the most
        likely failure modes identified through data analysis.

In summary, using historical data (Choice B) provides evidence-based
insights into past failures, while simulating the process with all
failure modes (Choice C) allows for testing and understanding the system
under various conditions. Together, these approaches offer a robust
methodology for pinpointing the root causes of fatal failures in the
battery system, making `Choice D` the most appropriate answer.

## **Question 11**

In mapping different X’s to a Y, the advantage of using linear
regression over a backpropagation artificial neural network (ANN) is:

a.  regression is more accurate in predicting Y’s given X’s compared to
    ANN.

b.  regression can handle more variables than ANN.

c.  regression handles data in a visible and transparent manner compared
    to ANN, which is perceived to be a black-box methodology.

d.  regression is more able to handle outliers.

### Answer

`c. regression handles data in a visible and transparent manner compared to ANN, which is perceived to be a black-box methodology.`

### Explanation

Choosing
`c. regression handles data in a visible and transparent manner compared to ANN, which is perceived to be a black-box methodology`
is the best answer for several reasons:

-   **Transparency**:
    -   **Linear Regression**: Linear regression models are simple and
        interpretable. The relationship between the independent
        variables (X’s) and the dependent variable (Y) is expressed in a
        straightforward equation. This transparency allows users to
        understand how the inputs are affecting the output, making it
        easier to interpret and explain the results.
    -   **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**: ANNs, especially those
        using backpropagation, are often considered "black-box" models
        because the internal workings are complex and not easily
        interpretable. The multiple layers and numerous parameters
        involved in ANNs make it difficult to trace how specific inputs
        influence the output, leading to a lack of transparency.
-   **Simplicity and Understanding**:
    -   Linear regression provides clear coefficients that indicate the
        strength and direction of the relationship between each
        independent variable and the dependent variable. This simplicity
        aids in understanding the model's behavior and the impact of
        each predictor.
    -   In contrast, ANNs involve weights and activation functions
        distributed across multiple layers, making it challenging to
        discern the contribution of individual predictors.
-   **Model Explanation and Communication**:
    -   The transparency of linear regression models facilitates easier
        communication with stakeholders, such as decision-makers who may
        not have a technical background. The ability to explain how
        changes in input variables affect the output in a clear and
        concise manner is crucial for gaining trust and buy-in from
        stakeholders.
    -   With ANNs, the complexity can be a barrier to effective
        communication and understanding, potentially hindering the
        acceptance of the model's predictions and recommendations.
-   **Debugging and Validation**:
    -   The straightforward nature of linear regression models makes it
        easier to identify and address potential issues, such as
        multicollinearity or the presence of outliers. Debugging and
        validating a linear regression model is generally more
        straightforward compared to an ANN.
    -   The complexity of ANNs can make it difficult to diagnose
        problems and understand why the model is making certain
        predictions, which can be problematic in critical applications
        where model reliability is essential.

In summary, while linear regression may not always be more accurate or
able to handle more variables than ANNs, its key advantage lies in its
visibility and transparency. This makes linear regression models easier
to understand, interpret, and communicate, which is particularly
important in many business and research contexts where model
explainability is crucial.

## **Question 12**

You are given three months to solve an analytics problem and the needed
data will require two months to collect. What would be the strategy with
the best outcome?

a.  Wait until the data are available to choose the best methodology

b.  Refuse to work on this project

c.  Ignore the data and design a tool that fits all possible scenarios

d.  Start developing the model with a template containing approximate
    numbers

### Answer

`d. Start developing the model with a template containing approximate numbers`

### Explanation

Choosing
`d. Start developing the model with a template containing approximate numbers`
is the best strategy for several reasons:

-   **Time Management**:
    -   Given the tight timeline of three months to solve the problem
        and two months needed to collect data, waiting until the data
        are available would leave only one month for model development
        and analysis. This is insufficient for a thorough and effective
        solution.
    -   Starting early with approximate numbers allows you to make the
        most of the available time, ensuring that you are prepared when
        the actual data arrive.
-   **Initial Framework**:
    -   Developing a model with a template containing approximate
        numbers helps establish an initial framework. This framework can
        be adjusted and refined once the actual data are available.
    -   This approach allows you to identify any potential issues or
        challenges in the model development process early on, providing
        more time to address them.
-   **Iterative Improvement**:
    -   By starting with approximate numbers, you can begin the
        iterative process of model development. Initial insights and
        results, even if based on rough estimates, can inform further
        refinement and optimization of the model.
    -   This iterative approach ensures that the final model is robust
        and well-tuned, as you will have had more time to test and
        improve it.
-   **Stakeholder Engagement**:
    -   Presenting an initial model, even with approximate numbers,
        helps keep stakeholders engaged and informed about the progress.
        It allows for early feedback and adjustments based on their
        input.
    -   This ongoing communication can build confidence in the project
        and ensure that the final solution aligns with stakeholder
        expectations.
-   **Risk Mitigation**:
    -   Starting with approximate numbers helps identify potential risks
        and limitations in the model early on. This proactive approach
        allows for the development of contingency plans and strategies
        to mitigate these risks.
    -   It ensures that any surprises or unexpected issues can be
        managed more effectively, reducing the likelihood of project
        delays or failures.

In summary, starting the model development with a template containing
approximate numbers maximizes the use of the available time, establishes
a solid framework for the final model, allows for iterative improvement,
keeps stakeholders engaged, and helps mitigate risks. This approach
ensures the best possible outcome within the given constraints.

## **Question 13**

One good methodology to reduce the dimensionality of a set of data is to
use:

a.  principal component analysis (PCA).

b.  linear programming.

c.  discrete-event simulation.

d.  artificial intelligence.

### Answer

`a. principal component analysis (PCA).`

### Explanation

Choosing `a. principal component analysis (PCA)` is the best answer for
reducing the dimensionality of a set of data for several reasons:

-   **Dimensionality Reduction**:
    -   **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: PCA is specifically
        designed for dimensionality reduction. It transforms the
        original variables into a new set of uncorrelated variables
        called principal components, which capture the maximum variance
        in the data. By focusing on the most significant principal
        components, PCA effectively reduces the number of variables
        while retaining the most important information.
    -   **Linear Programming**: Linear programming is an optimization
        technique used to find the best outcome (such as maximum profit
        or lowest cost) in a mathematical model with linear
        relationships. It is not designed for dimensionality reduction.
    -   **Discrete-Event Simulation**: Discrete-event simulation is used
        to model the operation of a system as a sequence of discrete
        events over time. It is a method for studying complex systems
        and processes, not for reducing the dimensionality of data.
    -   **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: AI encompasses a wide range of
        techniques, including machine learning and neural networks.
        While some AI techniques can be used for dimensionality
        reduction (e.g., autoencoders), PCA is a more straightforward
        and widely used method for this specific purpose.
-   **Efficiency and Interpretability**:
    -   PCA provides a clear and interpretable way to reduce
        dimensionality. The principal components are linear combinations
        of the original variables, making it easy to understand and
        explain the transformation.
    -   By reducing the number of variables, PCA helps improve the
        efficiency of subsequent data analysis and modeling, making
        computations faster and less resource-intensive.
-   **Preserving Variance**:
    -   PCA ensures that the reduced dataset retains the most
        significant variance from the original data. This means that the
        essential patterns and relationships in the data are preserved,
        which is crucial for accurate analysis and modeling.
-   **Wide Application**:
    -   PCA is widely used across various fields, including finance,
        genetics, image processing, and more. Its versatility and
        effectiveness in handling large datasets with many variables
        make it a go-to method for dimensionality reduction.

In summary, principal component analysis (PCA) is specifically designed
for reducing the dimensionality of data while preserving the most
important information. Its efficiency, interpretability, and ability to
retain significant variance make PCA the most appropriate and effective
method for this purpose.

## **Question 14**

You are given a set of data to be utilized for a model. Their level of
accuracy is within +/- 20%. What approach and/or software would you use
for the problem?

a.  Approach and/or software that deals with data at +/- 1% accuracy
    level

b.  Approach and/or software that deals with data at +/- 0.01% accuracy
    level

c.  Approach and/or software that deals with data at +/- 10% accuracy
    level

d.  Approach and/or software that deals with data at +/- 30% accuracy
    level

### Answer

`c. Approach and/or software that deals with data at +/- 10% accuracy level`

### Explanation

Choosing
`c. Approach and/or software that deals with data at +/- 10% accuracy level`
is the best answer for several reasons:

-   **Appropriate Accuracy Range**:
    -   When working with data that has an accuracy level of +/- 20%, it
        is essential to select an approach and software that can handle
        this level of accuracy. Choosing a method that deals with data
        at +/- 10% accuracy level ensures that the approach is not
        overly sensitive to minor inaccuracies but is still suitable for
        reasonably accurate data.
    -   Approaches and software designed for +/- 1% or +/- 0.01%
        accuracy would be too stringent and likely inappropriate for the
        given data. These methods assume very high precision, which is
        not aligned with the +/- 20% accuracy of the data.
    -   Conversely, using methods for +/- 30% accuracy might result in
        an approach that is too lenient, potentially overlooking
        important details and variability within the data.
-   **Balance Between Precision and Practicality**:
    -   Approaches dealing with +/- 10% accuracy strike a balance
        between precision and practicality. They provide sufficient
        accuracy without being unnecessarily stringent, ensuring that
        the model can effectively utilize the given data.
    -   This balance is crucial in maintaining the integrity of the
        analysis while accommodating the inherent variability in the
        data.
-   **Suitability for Modeling**:
    -   Methods designed for +/- 10% accuracy are typically robust
        enough to handle moderate levels of data variability. They are
        suitable for a wide range of modeling tasks, ensuring that the
        model can produce reliable and meaningful results.
    -   This level of accuracy ensures that the model remains flexible
        and adaptable, accommodating the inherent uncertainties in the
        data without compromising on the quality of insights and
        predictions.

In summary, selecting an approach and/or software that deals with data
at +/- 10% accuracy level ensures that the method is appropriate for the
given data's accuracy range, balancing precision and practicality, and
providing reliable results for the modeling task.

## **Question 15**

You are asked to establish a model to map many independent variables
(X’s) to one dependent variable (Y). The model should explain the level
of significance of the X’s to Y and their level of correlation. What is
the first methodology to come to mind in this situation?

a.  Stepwise regression

b.  Fuzzy logic

c.  Artificial neural network

d.  Monte Carlo simulation

### Answer

`a. Stepwise regression`

### Explanation

Choosing `a. Stepwise regression` is the best answer for several
reasons:

-   **Significance Testing**:
    -   Stepwise regression is a systematic method for adding or
        removing variables in a regression model based on their
        statistical significance. This approach helps identify which
        independent variables (X’s) have the most significant impact on
        the dependent variable (Y).
    -   It evaluates each variable’s contribution to the model and
        includes or excludes them based on pre-specified criteria, such
        as p-values. This ensures that only the most significant
        variables are retained in the final model.
-   **Correlation Analysis**:
    -   Stepwise regression provides insights into the level of
        correlation between the independent variables and the dependent
        variable. It helps in understanding the strength and direction
        of these relationships, allowing for a clear interpretation of
        how changes in X’s influence Y.
    -   By examining the coefficients and their significance levels, you
        can determine the relative importance of each variable in
        explaining the variation in the dependent variable.
-   **Model Simplicity and Interpretability**:
    -   One of the key advantages of stepwise regression is its ability
        to simplify the model by including only the most relevant
        variables. This leads to a more parsimonious model that is
        easier to interpret and understand.
    -   The stepwise approach ensures that the final model is not overly
        complex, making it more practical for communication and
        implementation.
-   **Incremental Improvement**:
    -   Stepwise regression allows for incremental improvement of the
        model by systematically testing the inclusion and exclusion of
        variables. This iterative process helps in building a robust
        model that accurately reflects the underlying relationships in
        the data.
    -   It provides a structured approach to model building, ensuring
        that each step is based on statistical evidence and contributes
        to the overall model quality.

In summary, stepwise regression is an effective methodology for mapping
many independent variables to a dependent variable, explaining the
significance and correlation of the variables, and developing a
simplified, interpretable model. This makes it the most appropriate
first choice in the given situation.

## **Question 16**

In INFORMS CAP® study guide, models are classified as:

b.  descriptive, prescriptive, and predictive.

c.  analytical, soft skills, and descriptive.

d.  simulation, optimization, data mining, and statistics.

### Answer

`b. descriptive, prescriptive, and predictive.`

### Explanation

Choosing `b. descriptive, prescriptive, and predictive` is the best
answer for classifying models according to the INFORMS CAP® study guide
for several reasons:

-   **Descriptive Models**:
    -   Descriptive models are used to summarize and describe historical
        data and understand what has happened. They focus on providing
        insights into past events and identifying patterns or trends
        within the data. Examples include summary statistics, data
        visualizations, and clustering.
-   **Predictive Models**:
    -   Predictive models use historical data to make forecasts about
        future events. They identify relationships between variables and
        use these relationships to predict outcomes. Common techniques
        include regression analysis, time series analysis, and machine
        learning algorithms like decision trees and neural networks.
-   **Prescriptive Models**:
    -   Prescriptive models go beyond prediction by recommending actions
        to achieve desired outcomes. They combine predictive models with
        optimization techniques to suggest the best course of action.
        Examples include optimization models, simulation, and decision
        analysis.

In summary, the classification of models as descriptive, prescriptive,
and predictive aligns with the INFORMS CAP® study guide, reflecting the
different stages and purposes of analytics in understanding past data,
forecasting future outcomes, and recommending actions.

## **Question 17**

A factory has skilled workers that operate complicated equipment and
there is a need to transfer the knowledge to new hires. The procedure
cannot be explained in a crisp manner with exact numbers. For example,
the operator cannot explain what the right temperature and pressure are
to maximize the strength of the material at a certain condition. They
simply just know by experience. One good candidate approach to model
that variables and rules is:

a.  fuzzy logic.

b.  neural network.

c.  linear regression.

d.  logistic regression.

### Answer

`a. fuzzy logic.`

### Explanation

Choosing `a. fuzzy logic` is the best answer for modeling variables and
rules in situations where the procedure cannot be explained with exact
numbers for several reasons:

-   **Handling Uncertainty and Vagueness**:
    -   Fuzzy logic is designed to handle uncertainty and imprecision,
        making it well-suited for situations where experienced operators
        rely on intuition and approximate reasoning. It allows for the
        modeling of concepts that are not easily defined with precise
        values, such as "high temperature" or "optimal pressure."
-   **Rule-Based Systems**:
    -   Fuzzy logic systems can capture expert knowledge in the form of
        fuzzy rules, which are expressed in natural language. For
        example, a rule might state, "If the temperature is high and the
        pressure is moderate, then the material strength is maximized."
        These rules can mimic the decision-making process of skilled
        operators.
-   **Flexibility**:
    -   Fuzzy logic provides a flexible framework for modeling complex
        systems with many interacting variables. It can integrate
        multiple fuzzy rules to produce a comprehensive model that
        reflects the nuanced decision-making of experienced workers.
-   **Ease of Knowledge Transfer**:
    -   By using fuzzy logic, the tacit knowledge of experienced
        operators can be encoded into a system that new hires can use.
        This approach facilitates the transfer of expertise without
        requiring operators to provide precise numerical thresholds for
        every condition.

In summary, fuzzy logic is a powerful approach for modeling systems
where knowledge is based on experience and cannot be precisely
quantified. It captures the approximate reasoning and decision-making
process of skilled workers, making it an ideal solution for the given
scenario.

### Answer

`b. Descriptive`

### Explanation

Choosing `b. Descriptive` is the best answer for associating
visualization with an analytics methodology category for several
reasons:

-   **Summarizing and Explaining Data**:
    -   Descriptive analytics focuses on summarizing and explaining
        historical data to understand what has happened. Visualization
        tools, such as charts, graphs, and dashboards, are essential for
        presenting this information in an accessible and interpretable
        manner.
-   **Identifying Patterns and Trends**:
    -   Visualization techniques help identify patterns, trends, and
        anomalies within the data. By providing a visual representation
        of the data, it becomes easier to spot relationships and
        insights that might not be immediately evident from raw data
        tables.
-   **Communicating Insights**:

## **Question 25**

When should you retire a model?

a.  When its replacement has been validated

b.  When a change in business conditions invalidate its assumptions

c.  Both a and b

d.  Neither a nor b

### Answer

`c. Both a and b`. If a change in business conditions has occurred that
invalidate the assumptions of the original model, a new or revised model
should be fielded and tested and validated before being deployed as a
replacement.

### Explanation

-   **Model Replacement**: Retiring a model is appropriate when its
    replacement has been validated. This ensures that the new model is
    reliable, accurate, and better suited to current business needs
    before the old model is phased out.
-   **Invalidated Assumptions**: When changes in business conditions
    invalidate the assumptions of the original model, it is necessary to
    retire the old model. The outdated model may no longer provide
    accurate or relevant insights, necessitating the development and
    validation of a new model.

In summary, a model should be retired when either its replacement has
been validated or when significant changes in business conditions render
its assumptions invalid. Both scenarios ensure that the business
continues to use accurate and relevant models for decision-making.

## **Question 26**

How often should model maintenance be done?

a.  When underlying assumptions change

b.  When it is ported to a new system

If the model performance is not evaluated, over time the returns may
become skewed and may not provide accurate answers to the original
question.

### Explanation

-   **Model Degradation**: Without regular evaluation, the model's
    performance may degrade over time due to changes in the underlying
    data, shifts in business conditions, or evolving market trends. This
    can lead to inaccurate predictions and poor decision-making.
-   **Misalignment with Business Goals**: As business objectives and
    conditions change, the model may no longer align with the current
    goals and needs. Regular evaluation ensures that the model continues
    to be relevant and effective in addressing the original business
    problem.
-   **Error Accumulation**: Over time, small errors and inaccuracies can
    accumulate, leading to significant deviations from expected
    outcomes. Regular performance checks help in identifying and
    correcting these errors early.

    maintained, stakeholders may lose trust in the model's outputs,
    undermining its utility and the credibility of the analytics team.
-   **Financial Impact**: Poor model performance can have direct
    financial implications, such as increased costs, missed
    opportunities, or reduced revenue. Regular evaluation helps in
    mitigating these risks and ensuring positive returns on investment.

In summary, evaluating model performance and returns over time is
crucial to maintaining accuracy, relevance, and trust in the model,
ensuring it continues to provide valuable insights and support effective
decision-making.

## **Question 29**

A multiple linear regression was built to try to predict customer
expenditures based on 200 independent variables (behavioral and
demographic). 10,000 randomly selected rows of data were fed into a
stepwise regression, each row representing one customer. 1,000 customers
were male, and 9,000 customers were female. The final model had an
adjusted R-squared of 0.27 and seven independent variables. Increasing
the number of randomly selected rows of data to 100,000 and rerunning
the stepwise regression will MOST likely:

a.  have negligible impact upon the adjusted R-squared.

b.  increase the impact of the male customers.

c.  change the heteroskedasticity of the residuals in a favorable
    manner.

d.  decrease the number of independent variables in the final model.

### Answer

`a. have negligible impact upon the adjusted R-squared.`

The increase in size of the data will not impact the adjusted R-squared
calculation because both samples are sufficiently large randomly
selected subsets of data.

### Explanation

-   **Sample Size and Adjusted R-squared**: Adjusted R-squared is a
    measure of the proportion of variability in the dependent variable
    explained by the independent variables, adjusted for the number of
    predictors in the model. With 10,000 rows of data already providing
    a substantial sample size, increasing the sample to 100,000 rows is
    unlikely to significantly change the adjusted R-squared value.
-   **Sufficient Data**: The original sample of 10,000 rows is already
    large enough to provide a reliable estimate of the model's
    explanatory power. Adding more data points typically has diminishing
    returns on the adjusted R-squared, especially when the initial
    sample is already robust.
-   **Statistical Significance**: While increasing the sample size can
    improve the precision of the estimates and potentially identify more
    subtle relationships, the overall explanatory power of the model, as
    indicated by adjusted R-squared, is likely to remain stable.

In summary, increasing the number of randomly selected rows of data to
100,000 will most likely have negligible impact upon the adjusted
R-squared because the initial sample size is already large enough to
provide a reliable estimate of the model's explanatory power.

send a promotional catalogue in order to attain a targeted response
rate. Which of the following techniques would be the MOST appropriate to
use for making this decision?

a.  Integer programming

b.  Logistic regression

c.  Analysis of variance

d.  Linear regression

### Answer

`b. Logistic regression`

This type of classification model is often used to predict the outcome
of a categorical dependent variable (response vs. no response) based on
one or more predictor variables, so this is the most appropriate answer.
The goal of the analytics in the stated problem is to determine who is
most likely to respond, and the binary nature of this predicted outcome
is provided by logistic regression.

### Explanation

-   **Binary Classification**: Logistic regression is specifically
    designed for binary classification problems where the outcome
    variable is categorical (e.g., response vs. no response). It models
    the probability of a certain class or event existing.
-   **Predicting Likelihood of Response**: In this scenario, the
    clothing company needs to predict which customers are likely to
    respond to the promotional catalogue. Logistic regression is
    well-suited for this task as it estimates the probability of
    response based on various predictor variables such as purchase
    history, demographics, and behavioral data.
-   **Decision Making**: By identifying customers with the highest
    probability of responding, the company can target its promotional
    efforts more effectively, improving response rates and maximizing
    return on investment.

In summary, logistic regression is the most appropriate technique for
deciding which customers to send a promotional catalogue to achieve a
targeted response rate, as it effectively handles binary classification
problems and predicts the likelihood of customer response based on
multiple predictors.

`d. Mixed integer programming (MIP)`

This is a mathematical optimization technique used when one or more of
the variables are restricted to be integers. It is an effective
optimization model.

### Explanation

-   **Mixed Integer Programming (MIP)**: MIP is an optimization method
    that extends linear programming to include integer variables. It is
    highly effective for solving complex decision-making problems that
    involve both continuous and discrete variables.
-   **Versatility**: MIP can handle a wide range of problems in various
    fields such as logistics, finance, manufacturing, and scheduling.
-   **Optimal Solutions**: By allowing some variables to be integers,
    MIP can model scenarios where decisions are binary (yes/no) or
    involve whole units, providing optimal solutions to problems that
    cannot be addressed by linear programming alone.

In summary, mixed integer programming is a robust and versatile
optimization method used for complex problems involving integer
constraints, making it the most effective choice among the options
provided.

b.  the 90% confidence interval around the mean.

c.  where the [actual-predicted] error value is not zero.

d.  if the data is skewed and, if so, in which direction.

### Answer

`d. if the data is skewed and, if so, in which direction.`

### Explanation

-   **Box and Whisker Plot**: This plot visually displays the
    distribution of a dataset by showing the minimum, first quartile
    (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and maximum values.
-   **Skewness**: The position of the median within the box and the
    length of the whiskers can indicate skewness. If the median is
    closer to the lower quartile (Q1) and the upper whisker is longer,
    the data is positively skewed. Conversely, if the median is closer
    to the upper quartile (Q3) and the lower whisker is longer, the data
    is negatively skewed.
-   **Outliers**: Box plots also highlight outliers, which are data
    points that fall outside the whiskers.

In summary, a box and whisker plot effectively shows if the data is
skewed and in which direction by displaying the distribution and
identifying outliers.

b.  A queuing model can be used to estimate average arrivals.

c.  Variability in arrival and service times will tend to play a
    critical role in congestion.

d.  Poisson distributions are not relevant.

### Answer

`c. Variability in arrival and service times will tend to play a critical role in congestion.`

Arrival and service time distributions are inputs to a queuing model
that would be used to model a checkout line and directly influence
congestion.

### Explanation

-   **Variability Impact**: In a multi-server checkout line, variability
    in arrival and service times is a key factor influencing congestion.
    High variability can lead to longer wait times and queue lengths,
    while low variability can result in smoother operations.
-   **Queuing Models**: These models are used to analyze and predict the
    behavior of waiting lines, incorporating factors such as arrival
    rates, service rates, and the number of servers.
-   **Poisson Distributions**: Often relevant in queuing theory, Poisson
    distributions typically describe arrival rates in many real-world
    scenarios. However, they are not the primary focus of this question.

In summary, variability in arrival and service times plays a critical
role in determining congestion levels in a multi-server checkout line,
making it a true statement about queuing models.

## **Question 35**

A company is considering designing a new automobile. Their options are a
design based on current gasoline engine technology or a government
proposed «Green» technology. You are a government official whose job is
to encourage automakers to adopt the «Green» technology. You cannot
provide funding for development costs, but you can provide a subsidy for
every car sold. The development costs and the wholesale price, in
thousands of dollars, of the cars are shown in the table below:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("q35.png")
```

How large a subsidy per vehicle sold will be required, assuming there
will be enough demand to motivate the switch?

a.  Greater than \$5000

b.  Less than \$5000

c.  Cannot be determined

d.  Equal to \$5000

### Answer

`a. Greater than $5000`

If we consider the profit from an individual vehicle to be the wholesale
price minus the variable cost, we see that the profit from a Gasoline
Technology vehicle is \$25K - \$15K = \$10K. Similarly, the profit from
a "Green" Technology vehicle is \$40K - \$35K = \$5K.

In order to make up for this difference in lost profit, the subsidy
provided to the automaker would have to be at least \$5K (the difference
between \$10K and \$5K). In addition, the subsidy would need to be
greater than \$5000 so that the automakers would be able to recover
their increased fixed costs at a reasonable level of demand.

### Explanation

-   **Profit Comparison**: The profit per vehicle for gasoline
    technology is \$10K, while for green technology, it is \$5K. To make
    the green technology equally attractive, a subsidy of at least \$5K
    per vehicle is needed to cover the profit shortfall.
-   **Fixed Costs**: Considering the higher fixed development costs for
    green technology, the subsidy must exceed \$5K to ensure automakers
    can recover these costs over time.

In summary, a subsidy greater than \$5000 per vehicle is required to
compensate for the lower profit margin and higher fixed costs associated
with the green technology, making it a viable option for automakers.

    involves finding the best combination of items to produce.
-   **Decision Variables**: These are the quantities of each item to be
    produced.
-   **Constraints**: The constraints include the budgetary limits and
    the known demand for each item.
-   **Optimization Technique**: Optimization is used to solve problems
    involving maximization or minimization of an objective function
    subject to constraints. In this case, linear programming or
    mixed-integer programming could be used to determine the most
    profitable mix of items.

In summary, optimization is the most appropriate technique to determine
the most profitable mix of items to produce under given constraints.

## **Question 37**

You have simulated the Net Present Value (NPV) of a decision. It ranges
between \$–10,000,000 and \$+10,000,000. To best present the likelihood
of possible outcomes, you should:

1.  Present a single NPV estimate to avoid confusion.

2.  Present a histogram to show the likelihood of various NPVs.

3.  Trim all outliers to present the most balanced diagram.

4.  Relax constraints associated with extreme points in the simulation.

### Answer

`b. present a histogram to show the likelihood of various NPVs.`

Net Present Value (NPV) takes as input a time series of cash flow (both
incoming and outgoing) and a discount rate and outputs a price. By
showing a histogram (a graphical representation of the distribution of
data), it is possible to see how likely various NPVs (beyond the given
minimum and maximum) are to occur. This would be useful information to
have when considering a decision, especially since the range of outcomes
includes \$0, meaning the decision could result in a profit or a loss.

### Explanation

-   **Distribution of Outcomes**: A histogram provides a visual
    representation of the distribution of NPV outcomes, showing the
    frequency of different NPV values within the simulated range.
-   **Likelihood**: It helps in understanding the likelihood of various
    NPV values occurring, which is crucial for decision-making under
    uncertainty.
-   **Risk Assessment**: By presenting the distribution of possible
    outcomes, stakeholders can better assess the risks and potential
    returns associated with the decision.

In summary, presenting a histogram is the best way to show the
likelihood of various NPVs and provide a clear understanding of the
potential outcomes.

## **Question 38**

A company ships products from a single dock at their warehouse. The time
to load shipments depends on the experience of the crew, products being
shipped, and weather. The company thinks there is significant unmet
demand for their products and would like to build another dock in order
to meet this demand. They ask you to build a model and determine if the
revenue from the additional products sold will cover the cost of the
second dock within two years of it becoming operational. Which of the
following is the MOST appropriate modeling approach and justification?

a.  Optimization because it is a transportation problem.

b.  Optimization because the company’s objective is to maximize profit
    and because capacity at the dock is a limited resource.

c.  Forecasting because you can determine the throughput at the dock,
    calculate the net revenue, and compare this with the cost of the new
    dock.

d.  Discrete event simulation because there are a sequence of random
    events through time.

### Answer

`d. Discrete event simulation because there are a sequence of random events through time.`

The time to load shipments depends on the experience of the crew,
products being shipped, and weather. Given there is a sequence of random
events through time, discrete event simulation is the most appropriate
modeling approach.

### Explanation

-   **Random Events**: Discrete event simulation (DES) is suitable for
    modeling systems where events occur at discrete points in time, and
    the timing and sequence of these events affect system performance.
-   **Variability**: DES can account for the variability in loading
    times due to factors such as crew experience, product type, and
    weather conditions.
-   **Capacity and Demand**: DES can model the impact of adding a second
    dock on system capacity and determine if the additional revenue
    generated will cover the cost of the new dock.

In summary, discrete event simulation is the most appropriate approach
for modeling the sequence of random events affecting dock operations and
evaluating the financial feasibility of adding a second dock.

## **Question 39**

Two investors who have the same information about the stock market buy
an equal number of shares of a stock. Which of the following statements
must be true?

a.  The risks for the two investors are statistically independent.

b.  Both investors are subject to the same risks.

c.  Both investors are subject to the same uncertainty.

d.  If the investors are optimistic, they should have borrowed rather
    than bought the shares.

### Answer

`c. Both investors are subject to the same uncertainty regarding the stock market.`

### Explanation

-   **Same Information**: Since both investors have the same information
    about the stock market, they face the same uncertainty in terms of
    market conditions and potential future movements.
-   **Market Risks**: Both investors are exposed to the same market
    risks, such as changes in stock prices, economic conditions, and
    market volatility. These risks are inherent to the market and affect
    all investors equally.

In summary, both investors are subject to the same uncertainty regarding
the stock market, given that they have the same information and are
investing in the same stock.

## **Question 40**

A project seeks to build a predictive data-mining model of customer
profitability based upon a set of independent variables including
customer transaction history, demographics, and externally purchased
credit-scoring information. There are currently 100,000 unique customers
available for use in building the predictive model. Which of the
following strategies would reflect the BEST allocation of these 100,000
customer data points?

a.  Use 70,000 randomly selected data points when building the model,
    and hold the remaining 30,000 out as a test dataset.

b.  Use all 100,000 data points when building the model.

c.  Randomly partition the data into 4 datasets of equal size, build
    four models and take their average.

d.  Use 1,000 randomly selected data points when building the model.

### Answer

`a. Use 70,000 randomly selected data points when building the model, and hold the remaining 30,000 out as a test dataset.`

This split provides sufficient data to build the model and sufficient
data to test the model. This is the best allocation of the customer data
points. (A common ‘rule of thumb’ is to use about two thirds of the data
to build the model and one third to test it).

### Explanation

-   **Training and Testing Split**: Using 70,000 data points for
    training and 30,000 for testing provides a robust dataset for both
    building and validating the model. This ensures that the model is
    trained on a large enough dataset to capture the underlying patterns
    and is tested on a separate dataset to evaluate its performance.
-   **Model Validation**: Holding out a test dataset allows for an
    unbiased assessment of the model's predictive accuracy and
    generalizability to new, unseen data.
-   **Common Practice**: The 70-30 split is a widely accepted practice
    in machine learning and data mining, providing a good balance
    between training and testing datasets.

In summary, using 70,000 data points for building the model and 30,000
for testing ensures a robust and reliable model, making it the best
strategy for allocating the customer data points.

## **Question 41**

Conjoint analysis in market research applications can:

a.  give its best estimates of customer preference structure based on
    in-depth interviews with a small number of carefully chosen
    subjects.

b.  only trade off relative importance to customers of features with
    similar scales.

c.  allow calculation of relative importance of varying features and
    attributes to customers.

d.  only trade off among a limited number of attributes and levels.

### Answer

`c. allow calculation of relative importance of varying features and attributes to customers.`

Conjoint analysis by definition maps consumer preference structures into
mathematical tradeoffs and was designed to allow a marketer to compare
the relative utility of varying features and attributes.

### Explanation

-   **Relative Importance**: Conjoint analysis allows researchers to
    determine how important different features and attributes are to
    customers by analyzing their preferences. This method breaks down
    products into their constituent parts and assesses the value of each
    component.
-   **Utility Measurement**: By presenting customers with various
    combinations of product features and analyzing their choices,
    conjoint analysis calculates the relative utility or value of each
    feature, providing insights into customer preferences.
-   **Trade-offs**: Conjoint analysis is designed to handle varying
    features and attributes, making it possible to trade off different
    aspects of a product to understand their impact on customer
    preferences.

In summary, conjoint analysis allows for the calculation of the relative
importance of varying features and attributes to customers, making it a
powerful tool in market research.

## **Question 42**

One of the main advantages of tree-based models and neural networks is
that they:

a.  are easy to interpret, use, and explain.

b.  build models with higher R-squared than other regression techniques.

c.  reveal interactions without having to explicitly build them into the
    model.

d.  can be modeled even when there is a significant amount of missing
    data.

### Answer

`c. reveal interactions without having to explicitly build them into the model.`

Tree-based models and neural networks are employed to find patterns in
the data that were not previously identified (or input into the model
building process).

### Explanation

-   **Automatic Interaction Detection**: Tree-based models, such as
    decision trees, and neural networks can automatically detect and
    model complex interactions between variables without requiring
    explicit specification by the analyst.
-   **Pattern Recognition**: These models are particularly good at
    identifying non-linear relationships and interactions within the
    data, making them powerful tools for uncovering hidden patterns and
    insights.
-   **Flexibility**: The ability to reveal interactions inherently
    without pre-specification simplifies the modeling process and allows
    for more comprehensive analysis of the data.

In summary, the main advantage of tree-based models and neural networks
is their ability to reveal interactions without needing to explicitly
build them into the model, making them valuable for complex data
analysis.

## **Question 43**

The monthly profit made by a clothing manufacturer is proportional to
the monthly demand, up to a maximum demand of 1000 units, which
corresponds to the plant producing at full capacity. (Any excess demand
over 1000 units will be satisfied by some other manufacturer, and hence
yield no additional profit.) The monthly demand is uncertain, but the
average demand is reliably estimated at 1000 units. At this level of
demand the monthly profit is \$3,000,000. Which of the following
statements must be true of the expected monthly profit, P?

a.  P can have any positive value.

b.  P is possibly greater than \$3,000,000.

c.  P is equal to \$3,000,000.

d.  P is less than \$3,000,000.

### Answer

`d. P is less than $3,000,000.`

When the demand is 1000 or greater, the profit is \$3,000,000. But when
the demand is less than 1000, the profit is less than \$3,000,000. Given
this and that the average demand is 1000 units, the expected monthly
profit must be less than \$3,000,000.

### Explanation

-   **Maximum Profit**: The maximum profit of \$3,000,000 is achieved
    only when demand is at or above 1000 units. For any demand less than
    1000 units, the profit will be proportionally lower.
-   **Average Demand**: Since the average demand is 1000 units, there
    will be times when the demand is less than 1000, resulting in a
    profit lower than \$3,000,000.
-   **Expected Value**: The expected monthly profit accounts for the
    variations in demand, and because it includes periods of lower
    demand, it will be less than the maximum possible profit of
    \$3,000,000.

In summary, the expected monthly profit, P, must be less than
\$3,000,000 due to the variability in demand and the fact that profit is
only maximized at full capacity.

## **Question 44**

After building a predictive model and testing it on new data, an
underprediction by a forecasting system can be detected by its:

a.  negative-squared.

b.  bias.

c.  mean absolute deviation.

d.  mean squared error.

### Answer

`b. bias.`

The bias measures the difference, including the direction of the
estimate and the right answer. Depending on whether it’s positive or
negative, it will show whether there is an over or under estimate.

### Explanation

-   **Bias**: Bias is the difference between the predicted values and
    the actual values. A positive bias indicates overprediction, while a
    negative bias indicates underprediction. It provides a measure of
    the systematic error in the predictions.
-   **Direction of Error**: Unlike other error metrics, bias indicates
    the direction of the error, making it useful for detecting whether
    the model consistently underpredicts or overpredicts.

In summary, bias is the metric that can detect underprediction by
indicating whether the model's predictions are systematically lower than
the actual values.

## **Question 45**

All times in the decision tree below are given in hours. What is the
expected travel time (in hours) of the optimal (minimum travel time)
decision?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("q45.png")
```

a.  7.8

b.  6.9

c.  7.4

d.  7.0

### Answer

`d. 7.0`

To answer this question, one needs to solve the decision tree using the
“rollback” technique. Continuing back the bottom branch of the tree, the
expected time if you fly is $(0.5)(9.0) + (0.5)(5) = 7.0$ hours. Now,
when faced with the “drive or fly” decision, you should choose to fly
(since $7.0$ hours is less than $7.35$ hours). Thus, answer `d` $7.0$
hours is the expected travel time of the optimal (or minimal travel
time) decision.

### Explanation

-   **Rollback Technique**: This involves working backwards from the end
    of the decision tree to the beginning to determine the optimal
    decision path.

-   **Expected Value Calculation**: The expected value of flying is
    calculated by considering the probabilities and the corresponding
    travel times.

If flying and it rains, the expected delay is:
$$0.8 \times 10 + 0.2 \times 5 = 9 \text{ hours}$$

If flying and dry weather, the flight takes 5 hours.

So the overall expected flight time is:
$$0.5 \times 9 + 0.5 \times 5 = 7 \text{ hours}$$

For driving, if it rains, the expected drive time is:
$$0.6 \times 9 + 0.4 \times 6 = 7.8 \text{ hours}$$

If dry weather, the expected drive time is:
$$0.3 \times 9 + 0.7 \times 6 = 7 \text{ hours}$$

The overall expected drive time is:
$$0.5 \times 7.8 + 0.5 \times 7 = 7.4 \text{ hours}$$

Since the expected flight time of $7 \text{ hours}$ is lower than the
$7.4 \text{ hours}$ for driving, the optimal decision at the root is to
fly.

In summary, using the rollback technique and calculating the expected
values, the optimal travel time decision is $7.0 \text{ hours}$.

## **Question 46**

An analytics professional is responsible for maintaining a simulation
model that is used to determine the staffing levels required for a
specific operational business process. Assuming that the operational
team always uses the number of staff determined by the model, which of
the following is the MOST important maintenance activity?

a.  Ensure that all the model input data items are available when
    needed.

b.  Determine if there has been a change in model accuracy over time.

c.  Ensure that all users are reviewing the model results in a timely
    fashion.

d.  Determine that the model’s reports are understood by the users.

### Answer

`b. Determine if there has been a change in model accuracy over time.`

The most important maintenance activity for the analytics professional
responsible for maintaining the simulation model is to monitor the
accuracy of the model over time. If there has been a change in accuracy,
the analytics professional may need to revisit the assumptions of the
model.

### Explanation

-   **Model Accuracy**: Ensuring that the model remains accurate over
    time is critical for its reliability and effectiveness. Changes in
    business conditions or input data can impact model performance.
-   **Assumption Re-evaluation**: Regularly checking for changes in
    accuracy allows for timely updates to the model's assumptions and
    parameters, maintaining its relevance and accuracy.

In summary, monitoring and maintaining model accuracy over time is
crucial for ensuring that the simulation model continues to provide
reliable staffing level recommendations.

## **Question 47**

A segmentation of customers who shop at a retail store may be performed
using which of the following methods?

a.  Monte Carlo Markov Chain and ANOVA

b.  Clustering, factor and control charts

c.  Decision tree and recursive function analyses

d.  Clustering and decision trees

### Answer

`d. Clustering and decision trees`

Customer segmentation consists of dividing a customer base into groups
of individuals that are similar in specific ways relevant to marketing,
e.g., age, gender, interests, spending habits and so on. The purpose of
customer segmentation is to allow a company to target specific groups of
customers effectively and allocate marketing resources to best effect.
Two ways to do this segmentation are clustering and decision trees.

### Explanation

-   **Clustering**: This method groups customers based on similarities
    in their attributes, such as purchasing behavior, demographics, or
    preferences. Common algorithms include K-means and hierarchical
    clustering.
-   **Decision Trees**: Decision trees classify customers based on
    decision rules derived from their attributes. They can help identify
    distinct customer segments and the factors that define them.

In summary, using clustering and decision trees for customer
segmentation helps identify and target specific customer groups
effectively, optimizing marketing efforts.

## **Question 48**

In the diagram below, what is true of Strategy B compared to Strategy A?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("q48.png")
```

a.  Strategy B exhibits stochastic (probabilistic) dominance over
    Strategy A.

b.  Strategy B has the same downside risk as Strategy A since the curves
    have the same shape.

c.  Strategy B must have the same uncertainties impacting it as Strategy
    A because the curves are so similar in shape.

d.  Strategy A exhibits stochastic (probabilistic) dominance over
    Strategy B.

### Answer

`a. Strategy B exhibits stochastic (probabilistic) dominance over Strategy A.`

Because the cumulative probability curve for Strategy B is below (or to
the right) of the corresponding curve for Strategy A, it can be said
that Strategy B exhibits stochastic dominance (SD) over Strategy A. B
stochastically dominates A when, for any good outcome x, B gives at
least as high a probability of receiving at least x as does A, and for
some x, B gives a higher probability of receiving at least x. Since the
curves do not cross, B stochastically dominates A.

### Explanation

-   **Stochastic Dominance**: This concept indicates that one strategy
    (B) consistently yields better outcomes than another strategy (A)
        across all levels of risk. It means that for any given
        probability, the outcome of Strategy B is at least as good as
        Strategy A, and often better.
-   **Cumulative Probability Curve**: The position of the curve to the
    right (or below) indicates higher probabilities of better outcomes
    for Strategy B compared to Strategy A.

In summary, Strategy B exhibits stochastic dominance over Strategy A,
meaning it provides better or equal outcomes across all levels of risk.

## **Question 49**

Each month you generate a list of marketing leads for direct mail
campaigns. Which of the following should you do before the list is used?

a.  Exclude people who were on the list the previous month.

b.  Retain x% of the leads as control for performance measurement.

c.  Remove opt-outs.

d.  Exclude people who were never on the list.

### Answer

`c. Remove opt-outs.`

The list of marketing leads should not include people or organizations
that have opted out.

### Explanation

-   **Compliance**: Removing opt-outs ensures compliance with
    regulations and respects the preferences of individuals who have
    chosen not to receive marketing communications.
-   **Customer Relationship**: Respecting opt-outs helps maintain a
    positive relationship with customers and avoids potential complaints
    or negative sentiment.
-   **Data Accuracy**: Keeping the list updated by removing opt-outs
    ensures that the marketing campaign is targeted at receptive
    audiences, improving the effectiveness of the campaign.

In summary, removing opt-outs from the marketing leads list is essential
to comply with regulations, maintain customer relationships, and enhance
campaign effectiveness.

## **Question 50**

When analyzing responses of a survey of why people like a certain
restaurant, factor analysis could reduce the dimension in which of the
following ways?

a.  Collapse several survey questions regarding food taste, health
    value, ingredients and consistency into one general unobserved “food
    quality” variable.

b.  Condense similar survey respondent answers into clusters of
    like-minded customers for market segment analysis.

c.  Reduce the variability of individual subject ratings by centering
    each respondent’s ratings around his or her average rating.

d.  Decrease variability by analyzing inter-rater reliability on the
    question items before offering the survey to a wide number of
    respondents.

### Answer

`a. Collapse several survey questions regarding food taste, health value, ingredients and consistency into one general unobserved “food quality” variable.`

Factor analysis is a statistical method used to describe variability
among observed variables in terms of a potentially lower number of
unobserved variables called factors. The information gained about the
interdependencies between observed variables can be used later to reduce
the set of variables in a dataset.

### Explanation

-   **Dimensionality Reduction**: Factor analysis reduces the number of
    variables by identifying underlying factors that explain the
    correlations among observed variables. For example, questions about
    food taste, health value, ingredients, and consistency can be
    grouped into a single factor representing "food quality."
-   **Simplification**: This process simplifies the dataset by
    collapsing multiple related variables into a smaller set of factors,
    making it easier to analyze and interpret the data.
-   **Identifying Key Factors**: Factor analysis helps in identifying
    the key factors that influence respondents' preferences, providing a
    more concise and meaningful representation of the data.

In summary, factor analysis reduces dimensionality by collapsing several
related survey questions into one general unobserved variable,
simplifying the data for analysis.

## **Question 51**

A preferred method or best practice for organizing data in a data
warehouse for reporting and analysis is:

a.  transactional-based modeling.

b.  multidimensional modeling.

c.  relation-based modeling.

d.  tuple-based modeling.

### Answer

`b. multidimensional modeling.`

Multidimensional modeling is the optimum way to organize data in a data
warehouse for analysis. It is associated with OLAP (On-line Analytical
Processing). OLAP data is organized in cubes that can be taken directly
from the data warehouse for analysis.

### Explanation

-   **Multidimensional Modeling**: This method organizes data into a
    structure that supports complex queries and analysis, typically
    involving multiple dimensions such as time, geography, and product
    categories.
-   **OLAP**: Multidimensional modeling is closely associated with OLAP,
    which allows for efficient querying and analysis of large datasets.
    Data is organized in cubes, facilitating fast and flexible data
    exploration.
-   **Efficiency and Usability**: Multidimensional models provide a
    user-friendly and efficient way to analyze data, supporting various
    analytical operations like slicing, dicing, drilling down, and
    rolling up.

In summary, multidimensional modeling is the best practice for
organizing data in a data warehouse, supporting efficient reporting and
analysis through OLAP techniques.
